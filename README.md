📌Who Am I:
I was born in Ankara on 10 October 2005. I lived there until I got six years old. Then we(me and my family) moved to Italy. We lived there for 3 years and I learned Italian and English in Italy. Then we moved back to Turkey. I am living in Turkey for 6 years. Every day I am trying to improve myself and learning new things.

👨‍💻My IT Story:
Actually I wasn't loving using technological gadgets before I started learning IT. It was even taking me a long time to locate the letters on the keyboard but now I can code web applications professionally and rapidly. I learned programming in an 8 month Full Stack course.
